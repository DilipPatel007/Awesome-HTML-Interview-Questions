15. **What are some best practices for using heading tags in terms of accessibility and SEO?**  
    - Use heading tags to create a logical structure for your content.
    - Use only one `<h1>` tag per page for the main title or heading.
    - Use heading levels appropriately to indicate the hierarchy of content.
    - Ensure that the content under each heading is relevant and follows a logical sequence.
